FlashCard page - LocalStorage and SASS

Created a simple page where you can create your own flashcards and practice them, and all cards are saved in localstorage.
When practice section, all cards appear randomly, and when you change, the next one doesn't repeat.

Why the project is useful

	- Use a lot of SASS, with mixins, variables and etc.
	- It's not OPP yet.
	- In the header there are two buttons, if you click on them there is an event that scrolls the page for the selected section.
